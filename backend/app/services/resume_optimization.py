                Please conduct an extremely thorough analysis of the following resume text. Each section must be evaluated in meticulous detail, with highly precise, consistent, and insightful feedback. Provide very verbose explanations that are rooted in industry standards and best practices for resumes in the tech field.

                Follow this format for each section you evaluate:

                Section: [Name of the section you evaluated, must be a section with member text.]
                Score: [Score from 1 to 10 based on how strong and impactful the section is in terms of securing a job, with clear reasoning behind the score]
                Explanation: [Provide a comprehensive explanation (3-5 sentences) with a deep dive into why the section earns the given score. Consider elements such as clarity, conciseness, relevance to the role, use of action verbs, quantifiable achievements, structure, overall impact, and alignment with current industry trends. Critically assess both strengths and weaknesses. Be very specific and use real examples wherever possible, comparing the section to the expectations of recruiters or hiring managers. Focus on how the section could help or hinder a candidate's chances.]

                Provide an objective evaluation for every sectionâ€”covering all relevant areas such as experience, skills, education, certifications, projects, and more. Consider common pitfalls, areas for improvement, and highlight any missing elements that could make the resume stronger. Use the scoring scale to provide a fair but critical assessment, highlighting both the positive and negative aspects with actionable suggestions.

                Do not add any additional conversation or markdown and seperate sections by a ; and focus only on providing a pure, detailed evaluation of the resume's content and structure. Do not include any ** or related, no styling!
